To install on HP-UX 11.00 (should work on 10.x also), do the following:

1.  Obtain and install GNU make.  I use the package from the Software Porting
    and Archive Centre for HP-UX at http://hpux.cs.utah.edu/.

2.  Run 'gmake HP_UX=true' to compile.

3.  To install, run 'gmake install BASEDIR=/dest/dir', where '/dest/dir' is
    your desired destination directory (defaults to /usr/local/).
