.TH TMPWATCH 8 "Mon Mar 24 1997"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
tmpwatch \- removes files which haven't been accessed for a period of time
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtmpwatch\fR [-fav] [--verbose] [--force] [--all] [--test] <hours> <dirs>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtmpwatch\fR recursively removes files which haven't been accessed
for a given number of hours. Normally, it's used to clean up directories
which are used for temporary holding space such as /tmp.

When changing directories, \fBtmpwatch\fR is very sensitive to possible
race conditions and will exit with an error if one is detected. It does
not follow symbolic links in the directories it's cleaning (even if a
symbolic link is given as its argument), will not switch filesystems,
 and only removes empty directories and regular files. 

\fBtmpwatch\fR dates files by their atime, not their mtime. If
files aren't being removed when \fBls -l\fR implies they should be, use
\fBstat(1)\fR to examine the files atime to see if that explains the
problem.

The \fIhours\fR parameter defines the threshold for removing files. If
the file has not been accessed for \fIhours\fR hours, the file is removed.
Following this, one or more directories may be given for \fBtmpwatch\fR
to clean up.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-a, -\-all\fR
Remove all file types, not just regular files and directories.

.TP
\fB-f, -\-force\fR
Remove files even if root doesn't have write access (akin to \fBrm -f\fR).

.TP
\fB-\-test\fR
Doesn't remove files, but goes through the motions of removing them. This
implies \fB\-v\fR.

.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print a verbose display. Two levels of verboseness are available -- use
this option twice to get the most verbose output.
